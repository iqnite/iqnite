# Welcome to my profile!

... where you can find a lot of cool stuff... and a lot of stuff where I don't remember why I made it in the first place.

In my free time, I like to make apps and games and tinker around with Raspberry Pi and electronics. You can find some of my creations here, some others on [my website](https://iqnite.github.io/). In my coding breaks I play around with Rubik's cube or the Perplexus (a thing I don't recommend you to buy). As I mostly work on Discord apps and Raspberry Pi, the programming language I use the most is Python in Visual Studio Code. I love Pyhon for its pragmatic syntax and VSCode for its features, but sometimes I wish some things were different, which is why I'm designing a programming language and an IDE myself. I would also love my girlfriend, if I had one...

Random nerd stuff: Marty McFly steps into his time machine in 2000 and travels back to the 80s. There, he meets Doc, who asks him what happened. Marty says "Previously, I was in the year 2000, then I traveled to 1980." If you consider that "previously" and "was" are words to talk about the past, it means that by traveling back in time, he experienced it as if he jumped forward in time.
