- üëÄ Student interested in coding, robots, Rubik's cube, and Spikeball
- üå± Learning C++
- üöÄ Working on too much (including a game and two programming languages)
- ‚è∞ Free time: too less
- üì´ You can reach me on [my website](http://iqnite.github.io).

‚≠ê My top programming languages rank:
1. C#: Flexible, feature-rich, and clear.
2. Python: Easy when you need it, complicated when you need it. Problem: The syntax isn't flexible.
3. JavaScript: Simple to understand and flexible, but it sucks when JS objects have different names than those in CSS.
4. C: The mightiest language, but with great power comes great responsibility, and great responsibility requires great sacrifice.
5. Scala: Easier and more flexible than Java, I simply haven't looked much into it yet.
