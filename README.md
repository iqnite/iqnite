- üëÄ Student interested in coding, robots, Rubik's cube, and Spikeball
- üå± Learning Rust
- üöÄ Working on too much (including a game and two programming languages)
- üì´ You can reach me on [my website](http://iqnite.github.io).

‚≠ê My top programming languages rank:
1. C#: Flexible, feature-rich, and clear.
2. Python: Easy when you need it, complicated when you need it. Problem: The syntax isn't flexible.
3. JavaScript: Simple to understand and flexible, but it has some really weird "gimmicks".
4. C: The mightiest language, but with great power comes great responsibility, and great responsibility requires great sacrifice.
5. Scala: Easier and more flexible than Java, I simply haven't looked much into it yet.

Random nerd stuff: Marty McFly steps into his time machine in 2000 and travels back to the 80s. There, he meets Doc, who asks him what happened. Marty says "Previously, I was in the year 2000, then I traveled to 1980." If you consider that "previously" and "was" are words to talk about the past, it means that by traveling back in time, he experienced it as if he jumped forward in time.
